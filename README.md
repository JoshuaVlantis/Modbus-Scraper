-This tool can scrape large amounts of data from Modbus Servers for analyzing or finding where registers are.

-This tool can also find what node IDs are being used on the Modbus Server.

Current save location Temp\log.txt
I am planning to allow users to select there own location in the next release

*The tool is still in early versions so there maybe some bugs or issues.*

*There is still alot of work to be done in terms of code clean up and optimizing searches.
All this will be done in future releases.
Any sort of feedback/advice will be much appreciated.
Any features you might want added or supported will be looked at*
